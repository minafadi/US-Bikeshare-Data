In this project, I used data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. I compared the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

The datasets:
Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:
Start Time, End Time, Trip Duration, Start Station, End Station, and User Type (Subscriber or Customer).

Statistics Computed:
#1 Popular times of travel: most common month, most common day of week, and most common hour of day
#2 Popular stations and trip: most common start station, most common end station, and most common trip from start to end
#3 Trip duration: total travel time, and average travel time
#4 User info: counts of each user type, counts of each gender, and earliest, most recent, most common year of birth
